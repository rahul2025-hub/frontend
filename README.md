## ⚙️ Local Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- Backend running at `http://localhost:8000`

### 1. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SkillNuronAI-frontend.git
cd SkillNuronAI-frontend/frontend

## 🔌 Backend Connection

All API calls are centralised in `src/services/api.ts`.

To change the backend URL (e.g. after deploying to Render), update this single line:

```typescript
// src/services/api.ts
const BASE_URL = "http://localhost:8000"; // change this for production
```

## 🔑 Authentication Flow

```
LandingPage
    → Select user type (Job Seeker / Recruiter)
    → LoginPage (Login or Register)
    → POST /api/auth/login or /api/auth/register
    → JWT token stored in localStorage
    → user_id passed through app via React state
    → Dashboard renders based on user_type
```

---

## 📦 Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

Output in `dist/` folder — ready to deploy to Vercel, Netlify or Render.

---

## 🚀 Deployment (Render.com / Vercel)

### Vercel (recommended for frontend)
1. Push to GitHub
2. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) → Import Project
3. Set framework: Vite
4. Set environment variable: `VITE_API_URL=your-render-backend-url`
5. Deploy!

### Update API URL after deployment
```typescript
// src/services/api.ts
const BASE_URL = import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL || "http://localhost:8000";
```

## 🧩 Key Components Explained

### `api.ts` — Central API Layer
Single file for all backend communication. Never write `fetch()` directly in components.

### `JobSeekerDashboard.tsx` — State Management
Holds the shared `skills` state that flows down to Profile, Gap Analysis and Career Path tabs via props.

### `PsychometricTest.tsx` — Assessment Flow
3 screens: Welcome → Questions (with dot navigation) → Results. Auto-advances after each answer. Minimum 10 answers required to submit.

### `JobRecommendations.tsx` — Live Data
Fetches real jobs from Adzuna India API via backend. Dropdown for role + city. Auto-searches on load.
